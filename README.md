# Personal Spending Tracker

A simple income/expense tracker that I'm building to learn advanced concepts in **React and Redux**. A work in progress. This project is a continuation of another project that I completed during Juno's Web Development Bootcamp, <a href="https://github.com/robinnong/robinNongprojectThree">a framework-less spending calculator</a> built with JQuery.

## To-do:
- [x] Show total balance at bottom of table
- [x] Allow users to add income + expenses
- [ ] Allow users to edit an expense 
- [ ] Multi-select to delete
- [ ] Responsive layout
- [ ] Accessibility check
- [ ] Subtle transition animations (adding and deleting)
- [ ] Authentication and Firebase storage
