# Personal Spending Tracker

A simple income/expense tracker that I'm building to learn advanced concepts in **React and Redux**. A work in progress. This project is a continuation of another project that I completed during Juno's Web Development Bootcamp, [a framework-less spending calculator](https://github.com/robinnong/robinNongprojectThree "Personal Budget Calculator") built with JQuery.
